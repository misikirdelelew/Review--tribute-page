					<h2 class="font">Here's a time-line of Steve Job's life:</h2>

					<br>
					<li><b>born June 28, 1971) is an entrepreneur, investor, and business magnate. He is the
							founder, CEO,
							and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early-stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla,
							Inc.;
							founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. With an estimated
							net
							worth of around US$273 billion as of April 2022,[6] Musk is the wealthiest person in the
							world
							according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and the Forbes real-time billionaires
							list.[7][8]</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father, and raised in Pretoria,
							South
							Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17
							to
							avoid conscription. He was enrolled at Queen's University and transferred to the
							University of
							Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics and
							physics. He
							moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue
							a
							business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The
							startup
							was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online
							bank
							X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by
							eBay in
							2002 for $1.5 billion.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services
							company, of
							which he is CEO and Chief Engineer. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer
							Tesla
							Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, becoming its CEO in
							2008. In
							2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services company that was later
							acquired by
							Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research
							company that
							promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a
							neurotechnology
							company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company,
							a
							tunnel construction company. Musk has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain
							transportation system</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>1976</b> - In 1976 he and Wozniak formed their own company. They called it Apple Computer
						Company, in memory of a happy summer Jobs had spent picking apples. They raised $1,300 in
						startup
						money by selling Jobs's microbus and Wozniak's calculator. At first they sold circuit boards
						(the
						boards that hold the internal components of a computer) while they worked on the computer
						prototype
						(sample).</li>
					<br>
					<li>Musk has been criticized for unorthodox and unscientific stances and highly publicized
						controversial
						statements. In 2018, he was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for
						falsely
						tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the
						SEC,
						temporarily stepping down from his chairmanship and agreeing to limitations on his Twitter
						usage. In
						2019, he won a defamation trial brought against him by a British caver who advised in the
						Tham Luang
						cave rescue. Musk has also been criticized for spreading misinformation about the COVID-19
						pandemic
						and for his other views on such matters as artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, and
						public
						transport.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.[9] His mother is Maye
						Musk
						(née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada,[10][11][12] but raised
						in South
						Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor,
						consultant, and property developer who was once a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near
						Lake
						Tanganyika.[13][14] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister,
						Tosca
						(born 1974).[12][15] His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous
						American-born
						Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys in a single-engine Bellanca
						airplane to
						Africa and Australia;[16][17][18] and Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>1988</b> - Jobs soon hired some of his former employees to begin a new computer company
						called
						NeXT. Late in 1988 the NeXT computer was introduced at a large gala event in San Francisco,
						aimed at
						the educational market. Initial reactions were generally good. The product was very
						user-friendly,
						and had a fast processing speed, excellent graphics displays, and an outstanding sound
						system.
						Despite the warm reception, however, the NeXT machine never caught on. It was too costly,
						had a
						black-and-white screen, and could not be linked to other computers or run common software.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>1986</b> - NeXT was not, however, the end of Steve Jobs. In 1986 Jobs purchased a small
						company
						called Pixar from filmmaker George Lucas (1944–). Pixar specialized in computer animation.
						Nine
						years later Pixar released Toy Story, a huge box office hit. Pixar later went on to make Toy
						Story 2
						and A Bug's Life, which Disney distributed, and Monsters, Inc. All these films have been
						extremely
						successful. Monsters, Inc. had the largest opening weekend ticket sales of any animated film
						in
						history.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Aware that it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[33] Musk applied for a
						Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.[34][35] While awaiting the
						documentation, he
						attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory
						service in
						the South African military.[36] Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, and lived with a second
						cousin
						in Saskatchewan for a year,[37] working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.[38] In 1990, he
						entered
						Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[39][40] Two years later, he transferred to the
						University
						of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1995 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a
						Bachelor
						of Science degree in economics</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>2005</b> - Steve Jobs with his Apple team began work on the first iPhone in 2005 and the
						first
						iPhone was released on June 29, 2007. The iPhone created such a sensation that a survey
						indicated
						six out of ten Americans were aware of its release. Time declared it "Invention of the Year"
						for
						2007.</li>
					<br>
					<li>In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage
						startup
						Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy
						storage, and
						at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games.[45] In 1995, he was accepted to a
						Doctor of
						Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in materials science at Stanford University in California.[46]
						Musk
						attempted to get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his inquiries.[34] He
						dropped
						out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch an
						Internet
						startup.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>born June 28, 1971) is an entrepreneur, investor, and business magnate. He is the
							founder, CEO,

					<p class="font">Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard
						and
						Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[99] Both men
						played
						active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[100] Musk led the
						Series A
						round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder,
						and
						joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[101][102] Musk took an active role within the
						company and
						oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business
						operations.[103]
						Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was
						ousted
						from the firm.[104][105] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in
						2008.[106] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along
						with
						Tarpenning and two others.[107][108] As of 2019, Elon Musk was the longest tenured CEO of any
						automotive
						manufacturer globally.[109] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to Technoking while
						retaining his
						position as CEO.
